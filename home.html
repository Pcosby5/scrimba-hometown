            <p class="first-text">
                Enjoy the unique culture of Ghana at the National theatre.
                The National Theatre of Ghana was opened in 1992 in Accra, the capital of Ghana, to spearhead the
                country's theatre
                movement by providing a multi-functional venue for concerts, dance, drama and musical performances,
                screenplays,
                exhibitions and special events. In Ghana, theatre as an artistic form has existed for centuries in the
                traditional
                dramatic expressions of society, however, the National Theatre Movement (NTM) was conceived around
                the time of
                Ghana's independence in 1957 to help remold the new nation's cultural identity. The theatre is governed
                by the National
                Theatre Law 1991, PNDC Law 259.The building houses the three resident companies

            <h4>2. Visit the Elmina Castle</h4>
            <p class="second-text">
                Elmina Castle was erected by the Portuguese in 1482 as Castelo de São Jorge da Mina (St. George of the
                Mine Castle),
                also known as Castelo da Mina or simply Mina (or Feitoria da Mina), in present-day Elmina, Ghana,
                formerly the Gold
                Coast. It was the first trading post built on the Gulf of Guinea, and is the oldest extant European
                building south of
                the Sahara.
                The Gold Coast gained its independence as Ghana in 1957 from United Kingdom and now controls the
                castle.Elmina
                Castle is a historical site, and was a major filming location for Werner Herzog's 1987 drama film Cobra
                Verde. The
                castle is recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, along with other castles and forts in Ghana,
                because of its
                testimony to the Atlantic slave trade.It is a major tourist attraction in Ghana.

            <h4>3. Visit the Mole National Park</h4>
            <p class="third-text">
                Mole National Park, one of Ghana's seven national parks, is the country's largest wildlife refuge.The
                park is
                located in the Savannah region of Ghana on savanna and riparian ecosystems at an elevation of 50 m, with
                a sharp
                escarpment forming the southern boundary of the park. The Park is 24 km from Damongo, the district
                capital, 146 km south
                east of Tamale, the Regional capital. The park is 700 km from Accra and 430 km from Kumasi.The park's
                entrance is
                reached through the nearby town of Larabanga.It covers an area of about 4,577 square kilometers of
                fairly
                undisturbed Guinea savannah in the northern part of Ghana.

            <h4>4. Visit the Kakum National Park</h4>
            <p class="fourth-text">
                Kakum National Park, located in the coastal environs of the Central Region of Ghana,covers an area of
                375
                square kilometres (145 sq mi). Established in 1931 as a reserve, it was gazetted as a national park only
                in 1992 after
                an initial survey of avifauna was conducted. The area is covered with tropical forest.The uniqueness of
                this
                park lies in the fact that it was established at the initiative of the local people and not by the State
                Department of
                wildlife who are responsible for wildlife preservation in Ghana. It is one of only 3 locations in Africa
                with a canopy
                walkway, which is 350 metres (1,150 ft) long and connects seven tree tops which provides access to the
                forest.
